        <h2>The path that I took....</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>The following apps were made as a part of my self learning path I took during my vacations. I learned about android programming, most useful the firebase which makes backend stuff seemingly easier for developers and allows you to integrate several high level functionalities in your android app. It also provides aythentication methods allowing you as a developer to make the users login in your app through Google, Facebook and many ogther services. Moreover it provides with with various database options as well so you can manage your data efficiently eliminating the headache of finding a server to host your app's database.</p>

        <p>The webapps I made were during the initial Covid-19 lockdown and I decided to add Angular JS and Node.js to my skill set. Again since I was familiar with firebase while working with android app development, Firebase made it easy for to develop my webapps as thewy provided same functionality for webapps also. </p>

        <p>As a developer I think that backend code is important , however one should not ignore front-end as it is the only part that is responsible for any user to make first impression for your application.
